# HykuKnapsack

Hyku Knapsack is a little wrapper around Hyku to make development and deployment easier. Primary goals of this project
include making contributing back to the Hyku project easier and making upgrades a snap.

## Introduction

[Hyku](https://github.com/samvera/hyku) is a Rails application that leverages Rails Engines and other gems to provide functionality.  A Hyku Knapsack is also a Rails engine, but it integrates differently than other engines.

### Precedence

In a traditional setup, a Rails' application's views, translations, and code supsedes all other gems and engines.  However, we have setup Hyku Knapsack to have a higher load precedence than the underlying Hyku application.

The goal being that a Hyku Knapsack should make it easier to maintain, upgrade, and contribute fixes back to Hyku.

See [Overrides](#overrides) for more discussion on working with a Hyku Knapsack.

## Usage

In working on a Hyku Knapsack, you want to be able to track changes in the upstream knapsack as well as make local changes for your application.

Perhaps the easiest way to do this is by making a fork of [samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/) on Github.  Cloning that fork.  And adding an upstream remote that tracks to [samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/).

Another approach is to do most of this via the command line:

- `$PROJECT_NAME` can only contain letters, numbers and underscores due to a bundler limitation.
- `$NEW_REPO_URL` is the location of your application's knapsack git project (e.g. https://github.com/my-org/my_org_knapsack)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scientist-softserv/adventist_knapsack $PROJECT_NAME_knapsack
cd $PROJECT_NAME_knapsack
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin $NEW_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Overrides

Before overriding anything, please think hard (or ask the community) about whether what you are working on is a bug or feature that can apply to Hyku itself. If it is, please make a branch in your Hyku checkout (`./hyrax-webapp`) and do the work there. [See here](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Hyku-Branches) for more information about working with Hyku branches in your Knapsack

Adding decorators to override features is fairly simple. We do recommend some best practices [found here](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Decorators-and-Overrides)

Any file with `_decorator.rb` in the app or lib directory will automatically be loaded along with any classes in the app directory.

### Deployment scripts

Deployment code can be added as needed.

### Theme files

Theme files (views, css, etc) can be added in the the Knapsack. We recommend adding an override comment as [described here](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Decorators-and-Overrides)

### Gems

It can be useful to add additional gems to the bundle. This can be done w/o editing Hyku by adding them as dependencies to `hyku_knapsack.gemspec`

## Installation
If not using a current version, add this line to Hyku's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "hyku_knapsack", github: 'samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack', branch: 'main'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```
